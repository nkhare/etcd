1. We use python-etcd to connect to etcd
https://github.com/jplana/python-etcd

2. etcd_load scripts contains predefined percentage and key range like following:-
#Pre-defined keysize distribution in percentage
pct = [5, 74, 10, 10, 1]

#Key size range
key_range = [0, 256, 512, 1024, 8192, 204800]

which effectively means create 
5% keys between 0 - 256 bytes
74% keys between 256 - 512 bytes 
and so on

for each pct value, we create one thread. In case above we create 5 threads.

3. Using the python logging module, log the time for each operation in a file. 
We use logged time to plot the graphs and get stats later.  

4. To run the script 
Create 1000 keys
$ ./etcd_load.py  -e localhost -p 2379 -op create -k 1000 -l /tmp/etcd.log

To get/delete/update 10 keys, we do following:-
$ ./etcd_load.py  -e localhost -p 2379 -op get -k 1000 -u 10  -l /tmp/etcdget.log
$ ./etcd_load.py  -e localhost -p 2379 -op delete -k 1000 -u 10  -l /tmp/etcddelete.log
$ ./etcd_load.py  -e localhost -p 2379 -op update -k 1000 -u 10  -l /tmp/etcdupdate.log

5. To plot the graph install matplotlib, pandas
$ mkdir /tmp/etcd_results
$ ./etcd_perf_plot.py -l /tmp/etcd.log -op create -o /tmp/etcd_results
